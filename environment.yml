    # Packages not readily available on conda-forge, or where pip is preferred
    # Currently, LightFM is often better installed via pip even in conda
    # But we want to try conda-forge first for everything else.
    # We will assume lightfm is available via conda-forge for now, if not,
    # it can be moved back to pip section.
    - requests # Ensure requests is handled by conda
    - python-dotenv # Ensure python-dotenv is handled by conda
    # No packages left to install via pip after moving to conda-forge where possible
